Subject: Follow-up and Treasury Yield Overview

Thank you for spending the time to speak with me today and giving me an understanding of your aspirations. As promised, attached is an overview of instruments we want you to take a look at. This was a very great meeting where we both gained a lot of insight about each other. We found some really good opportunities for your investment account. Also, since you asked, market yields are fantastic at this time so it's great to take advantage of them. You will be pleasantly surprised with all the good outcomes ahead. Of course, please note our disclaimers. I strongly feel that the market will rebound. The stocks are up 10% as of this month and your portfolio is in good shape. Stocks finished the week higher, capping the shortened holiday week. This quarter also saw the Dow Jones having its best quarter on record since 1987, closing up 17.8%. Favorable jobs data came in. We believe the better-than-expected economic news, coupled with the worsening external outcomes, shows an economic recovery is taking shape but there is still some distance to go before the economy can pick up full steam. 

In case you're looking for a confidence indicator, note that long-term treasury yields fell last Friday to their lowest levels since certain situations were looking better, as investors sought safe assets. Consider this as a sign of market confidence: the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to 1.284%, its lowest since a month ago, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury hit 0.600%, its lowest since 3 months ago. The spread between the two is the narrowest, at 0.682 percentage points. Bond prices rise when yields fall. A narrower gap between the two suggests investors, such as yourself, expect interest rates to hold steady. When when things started trending upward a few months ago, the spread widened as the market bet on rates increasing earlier than previously expected. Note that treasury yields fall when prices go up. The market's latest drop indicates an influx of investor capital to the popular safe-haven assets. 

You were also interested in an additional Roth IRA account. Now is as good of a time as ever. Your money can grow to be tax-free for retirement. Remember, the main benefit of a Roth IRA is that any earnings you don't withdraw will eventually be tax-free as long as you've had the account for at least 5 years and are over age 59 1/2, so this is very favorable for you. This can help you avoid higher tax brackets. For example, taxable income up to $80,250 for a married couple filing a joint return is currently taxed at 12% or less. Any income over that amount will be taxed at 22% or more. If a retired couple has $90k of taxable income, they could reduce it to the $80,250 limit by dipping into their tax-free Roth IRA(s) for the remaining $9,750 of income and avoid moving into the 22% marginal tax bracket. This would be even more beneficial if tax rates go up in the future. Since you're interested in buying a second house in Cape Cod, you can use Roth IRA earnings tax-free for a down payment on a home. In addition to withdrawing the contributions tax and penalty-free, you can also withdraw up to $10k of earnings penalty-free towards a home purchase as long as you haven't owned a principal residence in the last 2 years. If you've had the Roth IRA for 5 years, those earnings would also be tax-free. Since you have aspirations for Jake to attend college, this nicely parlays into it. Earnings can also be used penalty-free for qualified education expenses for your dependent children. Since it's considered a retirement asset, the account balance is generally not counted against you in calculating eligibility for financial aid. However, withdrawals from a Roth IRA do count as income for purposes of financial aid so be careful in which years you take the distributions. Before I forget, there are estate planning benefits too for a Roth IRA. 

A Roth IRA can pass directly to your beneficiaries without going through the time and expense of probate. Your heirs can then continue to benefit from tax-free growth by stretching the distributions over a period of time. Just something to consider as you've been discussing these plans with us. Let us know if you need any referrals to attorneys. Consider obtaining your estate attorney by getting referrals from professionals who have a long history of seeing the aftermath of the estate plans created by various attorneys. It's usually helpful to make a list of all assets, liabilities and insurance policies you have, including how each of these is titled and who the beneficiaries are. Also useful is contact information for all financial, insurance and legal professionals you have relationships with, usernames and passwords for any websites your beneficiaries may need to access, and a legacy letter designed to communicate nonfinancial items that you want to impart to your children. Once your estate plan and financial overview have been completed, I'd advise you to have a family meeting. The family meeting can be done with the parents and all of the children who will be inheriting assets. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to speaking with you again soon!
