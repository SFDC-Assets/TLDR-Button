I am writing to dispute the fact that I got charged late fees even though I never dipped into the negative balance. This is proven because not once this month I went under $2000 in my balance. I am really upset with this situation because I can't trust an institution who charges me faulty fees. Perhaps you will charge me other things mistakenly since you wrongfully charged me with this fee. I'm a new customer as of a few months ago and we're already off to a bad start. In addition to this frustration, I spent an hour being on a phone call with your representatives earlier this month because they were having issues setting up my direct deposit. My employer told me that they checked everything on their end and that the bank needs to reflect these changes on theirs. They said they never seen this issue with other banks. If I can't do business with you, I will be glad to do it elsewhere. I appreciate all the value propositions you display but your operational issues overshadow your value as a bank. Let me know if, perhaps, there is something I'm missing. I would be open to doing business with you if you sail this ship in the right direction. Otherwise, I'll move on. I have various accounts with you and I've already started talking to another bank about moving both of them over. Your value proposition is great in this area since you provide a cohesive experience about these. But, again, it may not be worth it due to the headache I get from being being your customer.
