I am writing to your company about a problem with my Hoverbike, a 2012 Skylark model. I began to have trouble staying aloft a few months ago, and this week the height control module completely failed. While the bicycle is a few months out of warranty, I believe that this occurred because of a design flaw in the Skylark, and I am asking that your company cover or share with me the cost of the required repair.

My parents purchased my Hoverbike (serial number 118532C423) for me on April 21, 2012 from our local authorized Hoverbike dealer, Krebs Cycles of Springfield. I have enjoyed riding my bicycle, but also taken good care of it, performing all recommended maintenance, keeping it meticulously clean, not hovering over bodies of water, and not riding recklessly.

After researching this specific problem and talking to other Hoverbike owners, I have learned that this is a common issue with Hoverbikes manufactured before 2013. I believe that the failure of this module was not due to neglect or error on my part. I am asking that the Hoverbike Corporation cover in full or share with me the cost of this repair.

I have enclosed a work order from my mechanic that details the repairs needed on my bicycle.

Hoverbike’s reputation and marketing emphasize your bicycles’ durability, reliability, and safety. Before this mechanical failure, I was very pleased with my Hoverbike, and in a few years I will need to upgrade to a larger one as I grow, but now I hesitate to choose one. My brother and sister also own Hoverbikes that are functioning perfectly, and they aren’t so sure that that they will stick with the brand after watching my experiences with the mechanical failure of my Hoverbike.

If your marketing campaigns are any indication, I am your target customer, a young girl who is allowed to explore her town on her own and use her bicycle for travel and recreational rides. More importantly, I am eight years old and look forward to a future of eco-conscious commuting. I hope to have many decades of cycling ahead of me, and I want to continue riding Hoverbikes in the future. Please restore my faith in your brand, stand behind your product, and cover the cost of this repair.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Sincerely,

I am writing to dispute the fact that I got charged late fees even though I never dipped into the negative balance. This is proven because not once this month I went under $2000 in my balance. I am really upset with this situation because I can't trust an institution who charges me faulty fees. Perhaps you will charge me other things mistakenly since you wrongfully charged me with this fee. I'm a new customer as of a few months ago and we're already off to a bad start. In addition to this frustration, I spent an hour being on a phone call with your representatives earlier this month because they were having issues setting up my direct deposit. My employer told me that they checked everything on their end and that the bank needs to reflect these changes on theirs. They said they never seen this issue with other banks. If I can't do business with you, I will be glad to do it elsewhere. I appreciate all the value propositions you display but your operational issues overshadow your value as a bank. Let me know if, perhaps, there is something I'm missing. I would be open to doing business with you if you sail this ship in the right direction. Otherwise, I'll move on. I have various accounts with you and I've already started talking to another bank about moving both of them over. Your value proposition is great in this area since you provide a cohesive experience about these. But, again, it may not be worth it due to the headache I get from being being your customer.

 I am writing to dispute the fact that I got charged additional fees even though I never made changes to my insurance policy. I have a few bills worth of $250 that need to be cancelled out by you. The amount is inaccurate because I haven't done anything at all yet I got charged. I am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance and other charges related to the disputed amount be credited as well, and that I receive an accurate statement. Also, enclosed are copies of the bills for reference sake. Please investigate this matter and correct the billing error as soon as possible.I am really upset with this situation because I can't trust an institution who charges me for fees I did not incur. Perhaps you will charge me other things mistakenly since you wrongfully charged me with this fee. I'm a new customer as earlier this year and we're already off to a bad start. In addition to this frustration, I spent an hour being on a phone call with your representatives earlier this month because of these - they were having issues because they said my policy ID wasn't providing them proper information in regards to this. Matter of fact, I called twice about this issue and the person who referenced my policy ID the second time got the wrong one. Your representative told me that they checked everything on their end and that they aren't sure how to help. They said they never seen this issue before so I asked them to escalate it. They didn't. If I can't do business with you, I will be glad to do it elsewhere. I appreciate all the value propositions you display but your operational issues overshadow your value. Let me know if, perhaps, there is something I'm missing. I would be open to doing business with you if you sail this ship in the right direction. Otherwise, I'll move on. I have various policies with you and I've already started talking to another firm about moving both of them over. Your value proposition is great in this area since you provide a cohesive experience as you service my entire family and my other relatives. But, again, it may not be worth it due to the headache I get from being being your customer.
